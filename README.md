# SWE 573 Software Development Practice

This is a Github repository created for SWE 573 course.

The initial aim of this course is to learn the use of Github.

## This section is added thorugh VS Code

I created a SSH key and added it to the ssh-agent by following instructions on Github's page.
Then, I could import the repository which contains this README.md file to my local machine by executing a "git clone + (SSH key copied from Github)" command in the terminal.
I made this modification to the README.md file in VS Code.

## Section for the new branch (feature-readme-instructions)
